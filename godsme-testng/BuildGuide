=========
	Linux(cygwin included)
	------
    run build_install.sh . (maybe you need to modify some variable in the script first)
	
	Windows
	-------
	One way:
	Run build_install.ps1 . (maybe you need to modify some variable in the script first)	
	The other way:
	Run cmake-gui.exe, choose the test-ng-pp root dir as source dir, and any other (nonexist) dir as binaries dir.
	Then hit configure button, it will show you some variables that should be set, you can modify them or let it be default, hit configure again.
	And then hit the generate button.
	At last, open the vcproj with Visual Studio and compile.
